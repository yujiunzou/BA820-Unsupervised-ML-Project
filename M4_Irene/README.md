**Notes:**
M4 refines from M3:
- Linking clusters to metadata and title themes to check whether rare clusters align with season, episode, or theme.
- Comparing linkage methods and rule parameters for rigor.
- Comparing palette clusters to title-based clusters (CountVectorizer + KMeans + cosine similarity) to see if text and palette structure align.
